Thank you!**

Hello there! This is my first fabric mod. It's an addon for the origins mod by Apace100, which adds items to the game to help make it easier for various origins, currently featuring Merlings, Enderians, Blazeborns. Elytrians, and Phantoms.

## Current features

 - Item that'd make origins' life easier, while keeping some kind of disadvantage.

 - A lot of stuff so download it to see what's in it

<ins>Note</ins>: The mod requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and the [Origins]([https://modrinth.com/mod/origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins)) mod in order to work. Not having them installed will result in malfunctions.

If anyone want's to make a tutorial video or generally a video including the mod, you're very welcome to. You can even share it in the comments and I'll add it here!


There is a [Discord server]([https://discord.gg/MzKD2yq8N8](https://discord.gg/MzKD2yq8N8)) dedicated to this mod which you can use to talk to other players and myself. Feel free to join!
